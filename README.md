## Unit 2 Content

Unit 2 focuses on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques:

- **Advanced**: Implementation of the `find_balanced_subsequence()` algorithm for analyzing art piece collections
- **Standard**: Various problem-solving exercises including:
  - `lineup()`: Maps artists to set times
  - `get_artist_info()`: Retrieves artist information from a festival schedule
  - `space_crew()`: Maps crew members to their positions
  - `data_difference()`: Finds differences between experiment data
  - `get_winner()`: Determines the most voted option

## Unit 3 Content

Unit 3 introduces more complex algorithms and data structures:

- **Standard**: Problems focusing on stacks, queues, and data management:
  - `is_valid_post_format()`: Validates balanced tags in social media posts
  - `reverse_comments_queue()`: Reverses the order of comments using a stack
  - `manage_stage_changes()`: Manages a schedule with additions and cancellations
  - `process_performance_requests()`: Prioritizes performance requests

## How to Run

To run any of the Python files:

```bash
python Unit2/session1standard.py
python Unit2/advanced.py
python Unit3/standard.py
```

Note: You may need to uncomment the test cases in each file to see the results.
