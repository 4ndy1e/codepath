Step 2: Step 2: Create a second instance of Villager in a variable named bones.
Step 3: Call the method greet_player() with your name and print out "Bones: Hey there, <your name>! How's it going, yip yip!". For example, if your name is Tram, "Bones: Hey there, Tram! How's it going, yip yip?" would be printed out to the console.

"""
Problem 3: Update Catchphrase
In Animal Crossing, as players become friends with villagers, the villagers might ask the player to suggest a new catchphrase.
Adding on to your existing code, update bones so that his catchphrase is "ruff it up" instead of its current value, "yip yip".
"""

bones.catchphrase = "ruff it up"

# print(bones.greet_player("Andy"))

"""
Problem 4: Set Character
In the previous exercise, we accessed and modified a playerâ€™s catchphrase attribute directly. Instead of allowing users to update their player directly, it is common to create setter methods that users can call to update class attributes. This has a few different benefits, including allowing us to validate data before updating our class instance.

Update your Villager class with a method set_catchphrase() that takes in one parameter new_catchphrase.

If new_catchphrase is valid, it should update the villager's catchphrase attribute to have value new_catchphrase and print "Catchphrase updated".
Otherwise, it should print out "Invalid catchphrase".
Valid catchphrases are less than 20 characters in length. They must all contain only alphabetic and whitespace characters.
